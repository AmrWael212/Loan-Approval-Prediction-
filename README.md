# Loan Approval Prediction

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details such as income, employment type, credit score, and loan amount.  
It uses **Python** for data processing, **Pandas/Seaborn** for data analysis, and **Scikit-learn** for machine learning modeling.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Load and explore the `loan_approval_dataset.csv` dataset
- Data cleaning: handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns
- Visualize relationships between features and loan approval status
- Train and evaluate classification models for prediction
- Provide insights into the most important factors affecting loan approval

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains columns such as:
- `loan_id`
- `applicant_income`
- `loan_amount`
- `credit_score`
- `loan_status` *(target variable)*

*(Ensure the dataset is in the same folder as the notebook before running.)*
